        Computed rather than declared, because it genuinely depends on what is

        interceptors it wraps. ``on_tool_end`` is defined here, so the adapters'
        audit-hook lookup **does** resolve on this object — the record is built
        and handed over — and it is then forwarded to the interceptor's own
        ``on_tool_end``.

        So the answer is the wrapped interceptor's, with one substitution: when
        the wrapped one resolves no hook at all, the record still reaches *this*
        object before stopping, which is ``discarded`` and not ``absent``. The
        distinction is not cosmetic — ``absent`` says nothing constructs the
        event, and here something does.

        A caller-supplied interceptor that really records is reported as such:
        this SDK does not claim anything about a handler it did not build, in
        either direction.
