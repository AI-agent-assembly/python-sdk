"""Governed pre-execution check backed by the native runtime ``query_policy``.

Wave 3 of AAASM-3021 (AAASM-3049). The framework adapters call
``check_tool_start(...)`` on the governance interceptor before a tool runs and
block when it reports a ``deny``. In production wiring the adapters are handed
the :class:`~agent_assembly.client.gateway.GatewayClient`, which has no
``check_tool_start`` — so that deny branch was dead.

:class:`RuntimeQueryInterceptor` wraps the ``GatewayClient`` and adds a
``check_tool_start`` that asks a connected
``agent_assembly._core.RuntimeClient`` whether the tool call is allowed, via
``query_policy``. The runtime is the authority: it redacts in place, so this
layer only ever *blocks* on an explicit ``deny`` and otherwise proceeds.

Failure posture is governed by ``enforcement_mode`` (AAASM-3106):

* Under an **enforce** posture — explicit ``enforce`` *or* the ``None`` default,
  which is advertised as the gateway's live ``enforce`` (AAASM-4130) — the SDK is
  a security control and **fails closed**. When the native extension is missing a
  deny-all interceptor is returned (no native authority exists to consult, so no
  tool call may be authoritatively allowed — AAASM-4760) alongside a loud one-time
  warning; previously this case returned the bare client and ran every tool call
  ungoverned while the session looked governed. Once the native extension is present
  every other failure likewise denies: an unreachable runtime socket yields a
  deny-all interceptor, a raising ``query_policy`` maps to ``deny``, and a native
  ``decision`` that is itself an error sentinel (``query_failed`` /
  ``channel_closed``) maps to ``deny`` rather than allow.
* Under the explicit dry-run postures **observe** / **disabled**, the SDK is a
  dry-run / hermetic-test layer and **fails open**: an unreachable runtime
  returns the bare client unchanged, a raising or error ``query_policy``
  proceeds, exactly as before.

The runtime remains the authority on *redaction* (it redacts in place); this
layer only ever decides allow / deny / pending.

    ``AA_RUNTIME_SOCKET`` environment variable takes precedence, otherwise the
    per-agent default ``/tmp/aa-runtime-<agent_id>.sock`` is used.

    Note: the ``/tmp/aa-runtime-<agent_id>.sock`` literal mirrors the canonical
    path baked into ``aa-sdk-client::AssemblyConfig::resolve_socket_path`` on the
    Rust side. This path is the SDK↔runtime IPC contract: ``aa-runtime`` binds
    the UDS server here and every SDK (Python, Node, Go) connects here. The SDK
    only *connects* to a path the runtime created; it never writes the socket
    itself. Operators who need to relocate the socket (e.g. multi-tenant hosts)
    set ``AA_RUNTIME_SOCKET`` to override. Replacing the literal with
    ``tempfile.gettempdir()`` would break interop on platforms where it does not
    resolve to ``/tmp`` (notably macOS dev hosts).

    Security (AAASM-3920): ``/tmp`` is world-traversable, so the default path is
    predictable and any local user can pre-create it to impersonate the runtime.
    The path itself is kept as the cross-platform IPC default to preserve interop
    with the Rust runtime's bind path, but two mitigations apply:

    * For hardened multi-user hosts, set ``AA_RUNTIME_SOCKET`` to a socket inside
      a per-user ``0700`` runtime directory (e.g. under ``$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR``) so
      the path is not world-traversable. The override is honoured unchanged.
    * Before connecting to the *default* path, :func:`connect_runtime_client`
      verifies the socket is owned by the current user (see
      :func:`_runtime_socket_is_trusted`) and refuses a foreign-owned squat,
      failing closed under ``enforce``.

    Robust peer-credential validation (``SO_PEERCRED`` of the connected peer) is
