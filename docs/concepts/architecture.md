# Architecture

This page describes how the Agent Assembly Python SDK is put together internally — what each module does, how they relate, and where the boundaries are between Python, the Rust FFI layer, and the governance gateway.

It is aimed at three readers:

- **Contributors** about to add a new framework adapter or change one that exists.
- **Operators** evaluating the SDK who need to understand the trust boundary between user code and the policy gate.
- **Future maintainers** picking up the codebase a year from now.

## Sections

- [Adapter pattern](#adapter-pattern) — how the SDK intercepts a third-party agent framework.
- [PyO3 FFI layer](#pyo3-ffi-layer) — the optional native fast-path runtime client.
- [`init_assembly()` lifecycle](#init_assembly-lifecycle) — bootstrap order, sidecar handshake, and shutdown.

## Adapter pattern

The SDK governs *third-party* agent frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents, Pydantic AI, Google ADK, MCP servers) without forcing those frameworks to be aware of Agent Assembly. The mechanism is a three-layer pattern:

### `FrameworkAdapter` (ABC) — the public interface

[`FrameworkAdapter`](../api-reference/index.md) at `agent_assembly.adapters.base` is an abstract base class that every framework adapter implements. It declares four lifecycle methods:

- `get_framework_name() -> str` — the framework's import name (e.g. `"langchain"`).
- `get_supported_versions() -> list[str]` — PEP 440 version specifiers.
- `register_hooks(interceptor) -> None` — install monkey-patches that route framework calls through the governance interceptor.
- `unregister_hooks() -> None` — revert all patches in reverse install order. Must be idempotent.

Adapter authors target this contract and nothing else. The public boundary is intentionally narrow so that adding a new framework does not require changes to the gateway client, the policy interceptor, or the registry's selection logic.

### `AdapterRegistry` — auto-discovery and priority ordering

`agent_assembly.adapters.registry.AdapterRegistry` enumerates the adapters that ship with the SDK, probes each one to see if its underlying framework is importable in the current process, and returns the available adapters in priority order. `init_assembly()` calls `get_available_adapters_by_priority()` exactly once at startup; this is the **single detection path** (see ADR-0001).

Priority matters because two frameworks can coexist in the same process — e.g., a LangGraph graph that contains a LangChain tool. The registry assigns each framework a fixed rank (`langchain` → `langgraph` → `crewai` → `pydantic_ai` → `openai` → `google_adk`, with `mcp` last as a fallback). LangChain installs first because its callback handler threads through to every adapter that follows; MCP installs last because it backstops any tool-dispatch path the framework-specific adapters did not claim. This ordering prevents duplicate event emission when adapters overlap.

### Per-framework patches — the actual monkey-patching

Each adapter's `register_hooks()` delegates to one or more `RuntimePatch` objects (a `Protocol` defined in `agent_assembly.core.assembly`). A `RuntimePatch` knows how to apply and revert a single monkey-patch on a specific framework class or function. Examples:

- `agent_assembly.adapters.langchain.patch.LangChainPatch` — patches `BaseTool._run` and `BaseTool._arun` so every tool invocation passes through the governance gate.
- `agent_assembly.adapters.langchain.langgraph_patch.patch_stategraph_compile` — wraps `StateGraph.compile()` so the resulting graph's nodes are wrapped before any invocation.
- `agent_assembly.adapters.crewai.patch.CrewAIPatch` — analogous wrappers for CrewAI's tool invocation entry points.

This three-layer split keeps the public API stable (the ABC) while letting per-framework patch code change freely as those frameworks evolve. ADR-0001 captures the rationale.

    Interceptor -.->|allow/deny| Gateway
```

Solid arrows are install-time; dashed arrows fire on every framework call after hooks are installed. The interceptor → gateway hop is the only network boundary in the data path.

The audit edge on that hop runs to the runtime, not to the gateway. The adapters offer every governed outcome to an audit hook on the interceptor; over a connected runtime that hook resolves and ships the record across the native event channel, so it enters the runtime's audit pipeline — for allowed calls as much as denied ones. Without a reachable runtime the hook does not resolve and no record leaves the SDK ([AAASM-5750](https://lightning-dust-mite.atlassian.net/browse/AAASM-5750)).

## PyO3 FFI layer

The pure-Python adapters described above are sufficient for governing most agent frameworks. For deployments where every microsecond of policy-check latency matters — typically gateways under heavy multi-tenant load — the SDK ships an **optional** native runtime client written in Rust and exposed to Python via [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/).

### What ships in the wheel

The native crate lives at `native/aa-ffi-python/` in the repository and is built with [`maturin`](https://www.maturin.rs/). When installed, it exposes a private `agent_assembly._core` module with two symbols:

- `RuntimeClient` — a Rust-backed runtime client (a thin shim over the shared `aa-sdk-client` crate). `agent_assembly` uses it for `register`, `query_policy`, and — since AAASM-5750 — `send_event`, which is how a governed call's outcome reaches the runtime's audit pipeline (`core/runtime_audit.py`).
- `GovernanceEvent` — Rust-side wrapper for the events that channel carries. It validates its argument as `aa_core::AuditEntry` JSON, and `core/runtime_audit.py` constructs one per forwarded outcome.

`agent_assembly/__init__.py` imports these symbols inside a `try / except ImportError` block. **If the native extension was never built, the SDK still works** — pure-Python `GatewayClient` is the fallback, and the `RuntimeClient` symbol simply is not present in `agent_assembly.__all__`.

### When to build it

Run the maturin build only if you need the native fast path:

```bash
uv tool run maturin develop --manifest-path native/aa-ffi-python/Cargo.toml --release
```

For most contributors, this is unnecessary — the pure-Python SDK is the default development path, and CI exercises both with and without the native extension via the `AAASM_RUN_NATIVE_CORE_TESTS` and `AAASM_RUN_MATURIN_TESTS` environment-variable gates documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ai-agent-assembly/python-sdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## `init_assembly()` lifecycle

`agent_assembly.init_assembly()` is the single entry point. Its job is to wire the SDK into the host process atomically — either everything succeeds and the agent is governed, or nothing was changed and the user sees an exception. It must never leave the process in a partially-patched state.

### Bootstrap order

1. **Validate inputs** (`gateway_url`, `api_key`, `mode`). Invalid arguments raise `ConfigurationError` *before* any side-effect runs, so retry logic in user code is safe.
2. **Create the gateway client** — pure-Python `GatewayClient` by default. If `mode != "sdk-only"` and the native extension is available, the assembly may switch to the Rust `RuntimeClient` (transparent to the caller).
3. **Discover adapters** via `AdapterRegistry.get_available_adapters_by_priority()`. Adapters whose underlying framework is not importable are silently skipped — no warning noise.
4. **Install hooks** by calling `adapter.register_hooks(interceptor)` for each available adapter, in priority order. Each adapter records the patches it owns so they can be reverted in step 9.
5. **Start the network layer.** This is the seam reserved for the sidecar handshake under `mode="ebpf"` / `mode="proxy"`; in this SDK all three branches currently return a no-op shutdown and start nothing, so no side-channel streams audit events from here — the record path is the native event channel opened at step 3, not this seam (AAASM-5750).
6. **Register the active context** in a process-global slot under a lock — `init_assembly()` is idempotent within a process: a second call returns the active context unchanged rather than double-installing hooks.
7. Return the [`AssemblyContext`](../api-reference/index.md) to the caller.

### Shutdown order (reverse)

The returned `AssemblyContext` doubles as a context manager (`__enter__` / `__exit__`). On `shutdown()`:

8. **Stop the network layer** — a no-op today, matching step 5; it holds no audit buffer to flush. Records already handed to the native channel are the runtime's; a send still in flight at process exit can be lost.
9. **`unregister_hooks()` on every adapter, in reverse install order** — guarantees that nested patches (e.g. LangGraph wrapping LangChain) come off in the order opposite to install.
10. **Close the gateway client** — drain the HTTP keep-alive pool.
11. **Clear the process-global active-context slot** — the next `init_assembly()` call starts clean.

If any of steps 8–10 raises, the others still run; the exceptions are aggregated into a single `AssemblyError` raised at the end of `shutdown()`. This guarantees no patch is left installed even when teardown is messy.

### Why a single entry point

The SDK deliberately exposes only one bootstrap function. There is no "init the gateway client without installing hooks" or "install hooks only for adapter X" public API — those would let user code drift into a partially-patched state where some tool calls are governed and others are not. The single-entry-point design makes the trust boundary uniform: either `init_assembly()` succeeded and **every** registered framework is governed, or it raised and **none** of them are.
