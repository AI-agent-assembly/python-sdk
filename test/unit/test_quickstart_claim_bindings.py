"""Drift gate binding the quick-start's claims to the controls that prove them.

AAASM-5529, Epic AAASM-5526.

Every sentence in ``docs/quick-start.md`` must be either **bound** to a control
that proves it, or **explicitly allow-listed** as making no capability claim.
There is no third state and no keyword filter.

Why the default is inverted
---------------------------

Earlier revisions only scanned sentences matching an enforcement vocabulary.
Review appended three plain sentences that used none of the 21 terms — the last
of them, *"Tool bodies always execute; the policy result is recorded alongside
them"*, is the negation of the product — and all three gates stayed green.
Widening 3 → 21 terms closed the instance and not the class: **a keyword
allow-list cannot be completed, because whoever adds the claim picks the words
after reading the list.**

So the vocabulary no longer gates anything. It survives only as a *severity
hint* in the failure message, and as the trigger for a stricter allow-list rule
(:data:`_ALLOWED` entries whose sentence matches it need a bespoke written
justification, not a category).

There are no section-level exclusions either. An excluded section was a black
hole: the guard checked the heading still existed and said nothing about its
contents, so a claim inserted into ``## Next steps`` was never scanned at all.

What this gate proves
---------------------

#. **Every sentence in the document is accounted for.** Add a sentence anywhere
   — any section, any wording — and it fails until someone binds it or
   allow-lists it by exact text.
#. **A binding matches a whole sentence, exactly** (``==``, never ``in``), and
   exactly one binding may match a sentence. Substring containment let a
   sentence carry extra unbound claims, including its own negation.
#. **Every control a binding names still exists**, extracted from the control
   modules' ASTs rather than transcribed.
#. **Every claim is proven or openly unproven**, with no exempt category, and an
   unproven claim must name a ticket that is *not* the ticket this module
   implements — a pointer at one's own ticket resolves to a closed issue the
   moment that ticket merges.
#. **Comments are stripped before scanning**, because a reader cannot see them.
   Leaving them in let a bound claim be commented out of the rendered page while
   the gate still counted it.

What this gate does **not** prove
---------------------------------

It does not execute, import or type-check a quick-start snippet.
``quickstart_snippets/`` is a vendored verbatim copy of regions from the
``examples`` repository (``ruff.toml`` excludes it), and the snippets reference
names they never define. The ``quickstart-tabs-check`` drift job round-trips
them as *text* only. Neither job runs a snippet.

Nor does binding a claim make it true. A binding records which control stands
behind a sentence; where none does, it says so and names the ticket.

#: Allow-list categories. A category is only permitted for a sentence that does
#: NOT match the vocabulary above; anything that does needs a written reason.
#: The ONLY bare constant. Permitted solely for structurally non-prose lines —
#: tab labels, table rows, migration import pairs, bare link-list items — which
#: are matched by _STRUCTURAL_LINE below. Every other entry carries a written
#: justification unique to that sentence.
#:
#: The previous rule required a justification only when the sentence matched the
#: enforcement vocabulary, which is backwards: the sentences that most need
#: explaining are the ones that EVADE the vocabulary, since evading it is the
#: whole reason the scan was inverted.
_STRUCTURAL = "Structurally non-prose: a bare mkdocs tab label, which renders as a tab caption and carries no sentence."

#: Lines that may use the bare constant.
#:
#: Fully anchored, and deliberately narrow. The previous pattern asked whether
#: a sentence STARTED with structure, not whether it was ONLY structure — so a
#: link item, a table row or a bold link was waved through on its first few
#: characters while its anchor text, which a reader sees as prose, went
#: unexamined. A payload as plain as
#:   [Every tool request is permitted to proceed and its outcome captured](x.md)
#: passed. Only a bare tab label qualifies now; everything else is justified.
_STRUCTURAL_LINE = re.compile(r'^===\s+"[^"]*"$')

#: A sentence that turns mid-way can under-claim and over-claim at once:
#: "Network-layer interception is not enabled by default, because the in-process
#: adapter already verifies every outbound request before it leaves the host."
#: The first clause is a limitation; the second is a fabrication riding along
#: under it. Rather than judge each case, the shape is rejected: an allow-listed
#: sentence may not contain a contrastive conjunction. It costs nothing on
#: genuine non-claims, because a sentence containing " but " should be split
#: regardless of what its justification says.
#:
#: Applied to EVERY entry, not only ones whose justification calls itself a
#: disclaimer. Keying off a marker phrase made the rule opt-in by the author it
#: constrains — capitalising the phrase, or omitting it, evaded the check.
#: "so" is deliberately NOT in this list. It is consequential ("therefore"),
#: not adversative, and both sentences it flagged here — "…against a local
#: policy, so you can try it with no API keys" and "…bundles the binary, so a
#: local gateway is available" — turn in the same direction they started.
#: Both attack payloads are still caught: the reviewer's used "because" and
#: the live Go case used "but". Controls for both are in the test below.
_CONTRASTIVE_CONJUNCTION = re.compile(r"(?i)\s(?:but|because|though|although|however|whereas|while)\s")

#: "so" is handled separately, because the risk it carries is not
#: adversativeness but POLARITY CHANGE. "We don't do X but Y" is a concession;
#: "we don't do X so Y covers it" is a REASSURANCE, and reassurance is the
#: register documentation over-claims in. A negated clause followed by an
#: un-negated one is the shape that hides an affirmative capability claim
#: behind a limitation.
#:
#: Flagging "so" flat would catch six live sentences across the three repos,
#: every one of which turns the way it started. This form catches none of them
#: and still catches the payload, which is the only negative-to-positive case.
